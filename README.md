# StassLea_FYP
Final Year Project simulation code for Stasson Lea "SLAM in Dynamic Enviroments" at the University of Newcastle. c3206105 

This Repo includes the required scripts to run a simulation in ROS's Gazebo that; produces a 3D octomap of a custom household enviroment; generates a spatiotemporal model of the enviroment which can be used to predict te changing state of the enviroment at any given time; and simulate the required path planning/navigation stack/control allocation to navigate a turtlebot3 waffle pi to a pose goal and back using the predicted state of the dynamically changing enviroment.
